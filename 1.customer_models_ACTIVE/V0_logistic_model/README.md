# ML for Pricing Technical Intro (Writeup on Logistic Regression)

I include a pdf write-up here that I put together to help give my managers an introduction to ML. It's a deep dive into logistic regression along with a step-by-step walkthrough of how to manually train a logistic function using Excel solver to model customer price sensitivity/elasticity. It's basically a summary of everything I learned in my first week or so of obsessively diving into ML, and it sort of explains a lot of the basics of the model fitting process: choose a learning algorithm, measure its performance against your dataset using the appropriate loss function, iterate by adjusting the weights until loss is minimized. Obviously there is a world of complexity beyond these introductory concepts but this paper summarizes my learning arc in the first 1-2 weeks of passionate deep diving into a totally new subject.
